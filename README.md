# ticket_classification
Build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.

Use topic modelling on the .json data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:

* Credit card / Prepaid card

* Bank account services

* Theft/Dispute reporting

* Mortgages/loans

* Others

With the help of topic modelling, map each ticket onto its respective department/category. Use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department.
